# PharoEyes
-- Can i?

a simple application for timing the application of eyedrops. 
Each drop has the same process of application. 
1. Apply the Drop and keep your eyes closed for 2 minutes
2. After the 2 minutes with your eyes closed, open them for a specific period of time
3. Wait 2 minutes between cycles. 

A set of 4 or 5 drops can take a large difference in time to apply and so this application allows you to time 
the steps of the process. 

This is the beginning stages of this application. It's not very complete.
